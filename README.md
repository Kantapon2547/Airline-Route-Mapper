# Airline Route Mapper

Airline Route Mapper is a Python-based application designed to find the shortest path between two airports based on the distances between them, utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient route calculation.

## Description

Airline Route Mapper leverages Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two airports using the provided airline routes dataset and airport information dataset. This project provides users with the ability to determine the shortest route considering the distances between airports. The interface offers a visualization of the route on a map, along with detailed information about the airports involved and the calculated distance.

## Main Features

- Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between airports.
- Input interface for users to specify origin and destination airports.
- Visualizes the shortest route on a map.
- Displays detailed information about airports involved in the route.
- Calculates and displays the total distance of the route.
